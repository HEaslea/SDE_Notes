GREAT BELIEFS: 14:20
1 you are cause rather than effect of your emotions
2 you are cause and not effect of outer results (agency)
3 belief in abundance of resources, not scarcity
4 feeds release muscles vs. control muscles (inspiration vs. desperation)
5 aligned to authentic core and highest potential version of self
6 sparks the power of self-fulfilling prophecy (positive RAS)
7 sparks the power of higher paradigm thinking (similar to #3, #6)
8 sparts the power of imagination and out-of-box thinking
9 sparks power of RAS ability to see opportunity (same as #6)
10 we choose our journey; we are overcomers and are not victims

All beliefs in scarcity are illusion, I am all, everything, there is nothing but me.

Escaping a normal belief system, finding what is truly outrageous for me to believe in. 
Doing what others can't. 
Finding what others can't. 

Can I employ the universe, to my fingertips. 

Be at the cause not at the effect. (That one gets deeper every year its crazy)
Agency- you're in control of every aspect of your life (opposite of disempowerment)
Abundance (unlimited money and people)
Release muscles - tension is the enemy
Feeds your higherself- if it dont feed it , leave it.
Believe there is an opportunity- see what you believe (ras)
Higher paradigm thinking- (seeing bigger picture, navigate accordingly)
Powerful imagination- finding solutions, finding the opportunity
If what you believe is stopping you from seeing opportunity, get rid of it.
I choose what comes to me. And to overcome it for my own growth. Push it to the limit homie .
Be a tank- literally transform into a tank and shoot ammunition from your nose. (Very big deal)
Gratitude gratitude gratitude.

That what is apparent of my thoughts, the content of what I say, think and do, is not from the brain, it is the culmination of consciousness at that moment. 
So worrying about the brain will not change the thoughts, I should be more changing my consciousness at that time. 

My inner and outer are one, they occur in the same realm. 
Shouldn't be worrying about the brain performing, the outer world is not coming from the "inner world" of the brain. They are one in the same, it's the after thought of the brain not performing well enough, when the brain is just a representation of the mental activity. They provide a representation of each "mind" being able to and each "body" being able to do, it's the scapegoat, everyone, and mostly you are using in order to blame One of faulting you.


I think when you are in the gaming community for so long, you lose, completely, your pair of fresh eyes. You see ghosts. Happenings of illusions. 


The drumming of their fists against their mithril braced chests, in numbers, sounded like the clanging of hammers onto anvils and hot metal. 


What is it about that thing, that if we took further, would be a fantastic story, would reach some hearts.
