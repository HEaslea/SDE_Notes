#istream

See [[ostream]]

`istream` is a class in C++ that represents an input stream, a sequence of characters from a source such as the keyboard, a file, or another input device. 
Part of the input/output stream library, allowing for reading from and outputting to various data sources. 
The `istream` class provides member functions for reading data from the input stream, such as the operator `>>`, `getline()`, `get()`. 
It is considered the base class of classes like `istringstream`, `ifstream` and `cin`.
