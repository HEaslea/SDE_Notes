Before a computer can use any type of storage device, eg. hard drive, CD-ROM, or network, we/the OS, has to make it accessible through the computer's file system.
This process is called mounting. 

Essentially we are placing access to the file system contained within onto our root file system structure. 

Giving us access to the files. 

On windows, this can look like `C:` or any other letter.
