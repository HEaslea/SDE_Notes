Somewhat based on my own story with with following religions, following messages and meditations and people who may or may not be true, in order to escape something. 

To run is human. 

There is a distinct fear of pain, suffering, there is a distinct love of freedom. 
I want the game to reflect sheer pain and suffering in the first act. 

In doing this, I will learn so much about myself. 

I want the earlier acts to be modelled on normal human life, set slightly in the future, with gameplay effects in. Player has doubt about what his life is, so much pain, suffering, that they don't want to believe in the reality they are in. 
Luckily they don't have to. After the turning point, the game becomes more magical, unreal, so far from that reality. 
It's a story about ascension, by running, then finally turning and embracing. 
The latter part of the story is more mental, like psychonauts. 
The end does not elude to whether the whole thing was a "dream" or not. 
Inspiration from American McGee's Alice. 
#### Act 1
Regular reality, set slightly in the future. I want this act to show the sheer pain and loathing and suffering the main character has. Main character is set.
