[[Overview of Sequential Containers]]


Containers hold collections of objects of a specified type. 
Sequential containers let the programmer control the order in which the elements are stored and accessed. 
The ordering doesn't depend on the values of the elements. 
The order corresponds to the position at which elements are put into the container. 
Essentially there is no ordering other than the order that they are added. 

There is also the idea of adaptors, which will be at the end.
