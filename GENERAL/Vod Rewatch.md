##### Lost Vikings
Whenever playing with lost vikings, the idea is that you have 2 extra people per pack, that do not need to soak lanes, therefore ganks can consist of 4 people without dropping any soak. 

Vikings are very very weak throughout the game, only really gaining power **IN LANE** around level 16 if not 20, when they can push lanes incredibly quick due to an AOE talent. 

Ganking and focussing on quests are therefore the priority at the beginning of the game. 

You have to find ways to ask questions of the other team. With the risk reward idea still in mind.

##### Li Li
Healing is slow at the beginning of the game. She is almost completely utility. Her healing automatically heals the lowest target in her general area. Similar to Vikings she is slow to get started. 
Her passive allows her to move very quickly depending on how much she has been hit, which also reduces basic ability cooldown. 





#### General: 

We linger far too much; team fights are not that important at the beginning of the game, try and be the first team to see other options on the map like soaking other lanes etc. 

Take note of which heroes we are trying to press: Azmodan, Anduin and Johanna mid, we aren't really going to get a kill there, and with Vikings, we should be more looking at ganks with kill potential, rather than trading. 
Unless you are Zul jin here, you should be scouting at other lanes for better opportunities eg. at this point Valla was a decent gank even if it means she just backs off, without a kill. 

Side Note: Getting someone to use their fountain off a gank is a successful gank, the fountains have quite a long cooldown. 

Going for mercs that early was fine, just didn't back away early enough, as Li li's heals are not that great early on, as soon as we see D.VA there, we back off, the risk to reward is not great. 

We trade 4 for 2 there and lose the mercs; mostly due to not backing off early, especially when we were so deep on their side of the map. 
The call was fine due to having Vikings, allowing for those freedoms to make more risky plays, as we mostly kept up in exp there, but we don't have to commit fully when it starts to go south. 

TOO MUCH ENGAGEMENT: A lot of our games, where we feel "stuck" or that they were just creeping ahead of us the whole game, us due to too much engagement. We can be in the same lane as them, but we don't have to fight. 
Due to the EXP mechanics in HotS, especially with Vikings, you can really take your liberties and just sit in a bush and wait out the lulling phases of the game; sort of like a jungler in LoL. You don't always have to show in lane, and then you don't always have to fight just because you aren't going to be last hitting. A bit of calmness.
