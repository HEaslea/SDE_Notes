The `vimfiles` folder is a special directory used by Vim on Windows to organize user-specific configurations, plugins, and other resources. It is similar to the `~/.vim` directory used on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS).

Here’s an overview of how the `vimfiles` folder works and what it is used for:

### 1. **Location of `vimfiles` folder:**

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\vimfiles`
- **Unix-like systems**: `~/.vim`

### 2. **Purpose of the `vimfiles` folder:**

The `vimfiles` folder is where you can store custom configurations, plugins, scripts, and other Vim resources. Vim automatically loads files from certain subdirectories within this folder to extend or customize its behavior.

### 3. **Common subdirectories in `vimfiles`:**

Within the `vimfiles` folder, you can create several subdirectories that follow a specific naming convention. Vim expects certain types of files to be placed in these directories:

- `vimfiles/autoload/`: Scripts that load automatically when needed, often used for plugins.
- `vimfiles/colors/`: Color schemes for Vim. Any `.vim` file in this directory will be available via `:colorscheme`.
- `vimfiles/ftplugin/`: Filetype-specific plugins. You can create subfolders for different filetypes (e.g., `html.vim`, `python.vim`).
- `vimfiles/plugin/`: Vim scripts and plugins that are automatically loaded when Vim starts.
- `vimfiles/syntax/`: Syntax highlighting definitions for different languages.
- `vimfiles/after/`: Files that run after any other plugins or settings are loaded (often used to override settings).
- `vimfiles/snippets/`: Snippet definitions for use with plugins like `UltiSnips`.

### 4. **How `vimfiles` works:**

When Vim starts, it checks the directories in the `runtimepath`, and `vimfiles` is one of the locations it looks for user-specific configurations and scripts. Any valid Vim script, plugin, or resource placed inside this folder or its subdirectories will be loaded or made available.

### Example Usage of `vimfiles` Folder:

- If you create a color scheme file `mycolors.vim` and place it in `vimfiles/colors/`, you can activate it in Vim using:
    
    vim
    
    Copy code
    
    `:colorscheme mycolors`
    
- If you want to install a plugin manually, you can place it in the `vimfiles/plugin/` folder.
    

### Integration with `runtimepath`:

By default, the `vimfiles` folder is included in Vim's `runtimepath` on Windows. You can verify this by running:

vim

Copy code

`:echo &runtimepath`

This structure allows for easy customization and modular extension of Vim.

Vim includes a built-in package management system (since version 8.0) that allows you to manage plugins or packages without the need for third-party tools like Pathogen, Vundle, or vim-plug. With Vim's native package management, you can organize and load plugins directly from specific directories.

### Key Concepts of Vim's Built-in Package Manager

1. **Packages and Plugins:** A _package_ in Vim is a collection of one or more _plugins_. Vim allows you to add packages by placing them in specific directories, and you can load them either automatically or manually.
    
2. **Package Directory Structure:** Packages are stored in a special directory under your `runtimepath`. On most systems, this directory will be inside `~/.vim` (or `vimfiles` on Windows). The standard structure looks like this:
    
    perl
    
    Copy code
    
    ![[Pasted image 20241017160014.png]]
    
    - `pack/`: The base directory for all packages.
    - `{package-name}`: A folder representing a package (can be named anything).
    - `start/`: Plugins in this folder are _loaded automatically_ when Vim starts.
    - `opt/`: Plugins in this folder are _optional_ and need to be loaded manually.

### Managing Plugins with Vim's Package System

#### 1. **Auto-loaded Plugins (in the `start/` folder):**

Plugins placed in the `start/` directory are automatically loaded when Vim starts. This is equivalent to how third-party managers like Pathogen or Vundle automatically load plugins.

**Steps:**

1. Create the necessary directory structure:
    
    ruby
    
    Copy code
    
    `~/.vim/pack/{package-name}/start/{plugin-name}/`
    
2. Place the plugin files in the `{plugin-name}` directory.
    

For example, to install a plugin called `nerdtree`, you could clone its repository like this:

sh

Copy code

`git clone https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/pack/my-plugins/start/nerdtree`

After this, the `nerdtree` plugin will be loaded every time Vim starts.

#### 2. **Manually-loaded Plugins (in the `opt/` folder):**

Plugins placed in the `opt/` directory are not loaded automatically. You need to load them manually within Vim using the `:packadd` command.

**Steps:**

1. Create the necessary directory structure:
    
    ruby
    
    Copy code
    
    `~/.vim/pack/{package-name}/opt/{plugin-name}/`
    
2. Place the plugin files in the `{plugin-name}` directory.
    

To load the plugin manually in Vim:

vim

Copy code

`:packadd {plugin-name}`

This can be useful for large plugins that you only need in specific circumstances, as it can help reduce Vim's startup time.

#### 3. **Listing and Managing Packages:**

- **List loaded packages:** You can list the packages that have been loaded with:
    
    vim
    
    Copy code
    
    `:scriptnames`
    
- **Add a package manually:** Use the following command to load a plugin from the `opt/` folder manually:
    
    vim
    
    Copy code
    
    `:packadd {plugin-name}`
    
- **Remove a package:** To remove a plugin, simply delete the plugin directory under `start/` or `opt/`. For example, to remove the `nerdtree` plugin:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `rm -rf ~/.vim/pack/my-plugins/start/nerdtree`
    

### Advantages of Vim's Built-in Package Manager

- **Simplicity:** No need for third-party tools, just create directories and manage plugins directly.
- **Native Support:** It is part of Vim itself, so you don’t have to install or configure any additional plugin manager.
- **Lazy Loading:** Plugins in the `opt/` directory can be loaded only when needed, reducing startup time.

### Example Setup

1. Install a plugin automatically on startup (e.g., `vim-fugitive`):
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git ~/.vim/pack/my-plugins/start/vim-fugitive`
    
2. Install a plugin manually (e.g., `lightline.vim` for a status line):
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim.git ~/.vim/pack/my-plugins/opt/lightline`
    
    Then load it in Vim as needed:
    
    vim
    
    Copy code
    
    `:packadd lightline`
    

Vim’s built-in package manager is lightweight and fits perfectly for users who want to keep plugin management simple without relying on external tooling.

The key things with these plugins is to put it in vimfiles/pack/WHATEVERFILENAMEYOUWANT/start
or instead of start, you can use /opt if you want to turn it on and off rather than it just load at the start
