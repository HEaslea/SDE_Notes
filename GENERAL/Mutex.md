Here is a cool idea that is present in this: 
[C++ Tours](https://isocpp.org/files/papers/5-Tour-Util.pdf)

When I am having a big heated discussion at work, I use a rubber chicken which I keep in my desk for just such occasions. The person holding the chicken is the only person who is allowed to talk. If you don't hold the chicken you cannot speak. You can only indicate that you want the chicken and wait until you get it before you speak. Once you have finished speaking, you can hand the chicken back to the moderator who will hand it to the next person to speak. This ensures that people do not speak over each other, and also have their own space to talk.

Now replace Chicken with Mutex and person with thread and you basically have the concept of a mutex. 

They are **Mutually Exclusive Flag**, acting as a gate keeper to a section of code allowing one thread in and blocking access to all others. 
Just make sure you release it when you are done with it.
