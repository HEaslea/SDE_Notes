#insertiterators

An inserter will be an iterator adaptor that takes a container and yields an iterator that adds elements to the specified container. 

When we assign a value through an insert iterator, in the same way that stack and queue adaptors do, the adaptor will call a container function at the specified position in the given container. 

The way i like to think about these things is that they are another way to call particular functions, they pass in arguments by themselves to the container. They also have added functionality, in the sense that we can move the iterator as a style of indexing.

`back_inserter` will use `push_back`;

`front_inserter` will use `push_front`; 

`inserter` creates an iterator that uses `insert`, taking a second argument, which must be an iterator into the given container. Elements are inserted ahead of the element denotes by the given iterator. 

We can use these, only if the container has that actual functionality. 

**PLEASE NOTE**, when we use `inserter(c, iter)`, we get an iterator that, when used successively, inserts elements ahead of the element originally denotes by `iter`.

If `it` is an iterator generated by `inserter`, then an assignment like this; 
```
*it = va1;
// is the same as
it = c.insert(it, val);// it points to the newly added element
++it; // increment it so that it denotes the same element as before
```
The `front_inserter` will behave quite differently. 

```
list<int> lst = {1,2,3,4};
list<int> lst2, lst3; // empty lists 
// after copy completes, lst2 will contain 4 3 2 1
copy(lst.cbegin(), lst.cend(), front_inserter(lst2));
// after copy completes, lst3 contains 1 2 3 4
copy(lst.begin(), lst.end(), inserter(lst3, lst3.begin()));
```

When we call `front_inserter(c)`, we get an inserter that successively calls `push_front`. 
As each element is inserted, it becomes the new first element in c. 
Therefore, `front_inserter` yields an iterator that reverses the order of the sequence that it inserts: `inserter and back_inserter` don't.
