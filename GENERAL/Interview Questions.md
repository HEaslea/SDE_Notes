Become one of the best software engineers in the world. 
I will already be doing the work anyways, of my own volition, 
Proper mentorship - proper guidance
Breaking into this new job - passion - 

I will answer the latter part of the question first - As someone slightly older, who has found an incredible passion for software engineering, I so desperately want to put myself into a professional setting as soon as possible. I am and will be doing the work anyways, so having that mentorship would be invaluable. I believe it will be the best place for me to grow and develop these skills, definitely over something like university. 

Why Amazon? : I feel that I have grown and developed, particularly in the last 4 years, to align with a lot of the core principles that amazon appreciates. I love the high standards, and customer obsession, which are must haves for the role I'm currently in. Learning and being curious are principles that I practice daily while I'm doing my own personal studying. 
But the main one is the big thinking; I want to be one of the best software engineers in the world, and I believe that Amazon is most certainly the place that can help me with that, and then, potentially I help Amazon change the world too. 

I'll start with why I would prefer an apprenticeship; As someone slightly older, who has discovered an incredible passion for software engineering, I am so excited with the prospect of making this my career. It's really all I think about currently. I want to immerse myself into a professional environment as soon as I can. For over a year, much of the work I have been doing is independent, which is great, but I believe the best way for me to develop now is with expert guidance and mentorship. 
I believe an apprenticeship also gives me the opportunity, having missed the boat for university earlier in my life, to flourish. 
I also think that Amazon can continue to change the world, and I want to be a part of that too. 


With guidance I would develop and flourish much faster. I'm so excited to get into a professional environment that shares my high standards. It's the perfect opportunity and next step for someone who also engages in as much independent study as I do. 
Perfect way to prove how capable I am, without having all the knowledge at the beginning, before jumping into an entry level role. 

There are a lot of reasons why an apprenticeship is the right option for me. 
I don't believe the more general course at a University would suit me, as I have come to love this role specifically. 

I believe that an apprenticeship gives someone in my position the greatest and most exciting opportunity to learn and work in a professional environment. 

I believe an apprenticeship gives someone in my position, who is working hard independently to work to be a suitable level to work in a professional environment, the best opportunity. 

I believe an apprenticeship offers the best opportunity for someone in my position. Who is working diligently working on reaching a professional level independently. 
It offers an environment around experts to allow me to flourish and develop into the best I can be. 

I know I'm capable of so much more and am so excited to get into a professional environment to allow me to flourish and develop to be the best I can be. 

I know I am capable of achieving so much more, and I am excited about the opportunity to enter a professional environment that will allow me to flourish, grow, and reach my full potential.
