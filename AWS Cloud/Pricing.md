Logistics and pricing and cost and money money money. 

How do I pay for all this - how to do I get everyone their paycheck. 

How much for next month as well. 

Predictions. 

What would be the cost if X? 

## AWS Free Tier
Brand new account - great for trying out - depending on product 

1. always free - to every customer - will always remain free
2. 12 months free
3. Trials - short term trial and then pay for it

AWS Lambda - < 1 mil invocations is free 

S3 - free for 12 months up to 5 GB of standard storage

LightSail - 1 month of 750 hours of usage - automate website stuff 


## AWS Pricing Concepts
Pay-as-you-go prcing. 

Pay for what you use. 

Pay less when you reserve - Eg. EC2 instance saving plan. 

The more you use the less you pay - volume based discounts - the more S3 you use, the less you pay per GB.

#### Examples
AWS Lambda - charged by number of requests, and the time it takes for them to run. 1 Mil free requests and up to 3.2 mil seconds of compute timer per month. 
Competitive Savings Plan, lower compute costs in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage over 1 - year or a 3 - year term. 
Paying less when you reserve. 

EC2 - Pay for compute time while your instances are running. 
Spot instances - only when there are available instances, so they can be interrupted. 90% cost savings. 

S3 - Simple Storage System - 
Pay for what storage we use - size - type - and how long we've stored each per month. 
Requests and Data retrievals 
Data Transfers
Management and Replication

## Consolidate Billing 
Every coffee shop has expenses and billing - etc. 
One entity to oversee them all - We bill the organization. 

A company might have multiple accounts - Organizations - Consolidated Billings 

One bill for the whole of AWS - still view itemized - but just spend all the money at once. 
Bulk discount with the aggregate of the accounts. 

Default organization max is 4, but you can change that with support. 

Itemized charges for each account. 
Greater Transparency - only one monthly bill. 

Share bulk discount pricing eg. add all storage usage to one org. 

## AWS Budgets
Ramping up deployments - make sure we don't overspend - keep limits - Budgets obviously - think of a personal budget - custom budgets for scenarios like costs and usage - then alert when exceeding. 
Proactively notified - prediction - if we are to exceed. 

## AWS Cost Explorer
Variable cost model - only pay for what you use - no fixed bill amount - fluctuates - drill into the bill and see how we spend money - we explore our bills - how are we spending money - where we spending? and 12 month historical data.
