Isotopes - atoms of the same element (same atomic number) - but with different numbers of neutrons


Relative Isotopic Mass - The mass **of a single isotope** relative to 1/12 the mass of a 12C atom. 

Relative Atomic Mass - This is the average weighted mass of all the isotopes of an element compared to 1/12 of the mass of 12C atom. 

Atomic Number - The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom

Mass Number - Number of protons + number of neutrons. 

Relative Molecular Mass (Mr) - Sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms in a molecule - used when we have discrete molecules (H2O, CO2 etc.) 

Relative Formula Mass (Mr) - Also the sum of atomic masses, used for ionic and giant covalent substances (like NaCl, MgO, or SiO2) - just a distinction between the two is that the formula mass takes the mass from the formula - as those structures are going to be giant. 

Mass Spectrometry - looking at the isotopes of an element:

How it works: 
1. Vaporisation - turning the sample into a gas
2. Ionisation - Atoms/Molecules are hit with high energy electrons forming positive ions (usually + 1 charge). 
3. Ions are accelerated by an electric field. 
4. Then we have to separate mass/charge (m/Z)

M + 1 refers to the peak corresponding to the molecule plus one additional neutron. 

M Represents the most abundant isotope of an element. 
Typically the one with lower mass. 

Fragmentation - breaking the molecule into smaller pieces (fragments) during the ionisation process. 
They can be detected: 
They provide good information about the structure of the molecule. 

M+ is molecular ion peak - intact molecule with a positive charge - this ion has the same mass as the original molecule (doesn't fragment). 

This has to be the highest m/z value corresponds to the molecular ion (M+). 

M - for molecule (the molecule itself). 

The height of the M + 1 peak gives information about the presesnce of isotopes in the sample. 
- **M⁺**: The molecular ion, corresponding to the most abundant isotope.
    
- **M + 1**: The peak caused by molecules with one extra neutron (e.g., **C-13**), typically seen at **1 mass unit higher** than **M⁺**.
    
- **M + 1** is a small peak due to the rarity of the isotope (e.g., **C-13** makes up about 1% of carbon atoms).
![[Pasted image 20250506172102.png]]

M + n : where n is the mass units different between the two. 

![[Pasted image 20250506172318.png]]

M+ is the most abundant one that we have - most abundant ion, that is the most intact, without any fragmentation, most common isotopic form. 

Ionisation Energy - IE - Amount of energy needed to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of **gaseous atoms** to form one mol of **gaseous ions**. 

This will be in *kiloJoules per mol*. 

![[Pasted image 20250506172951.png]]
More can be removed - successive ionisation energies of an element. 

Second Ionisation Energy - the energy required to remove one mole of electrons from one mole of gaseous + 1 ions to form one mol of gaseous + 2 ions. 
![[Pasted image 20250506173118.png]]
Then there is the third ionisation energy as well. 

Increase as we are trying to remove e- from positive ions. that is more difficult. 

There is an increase of proton to electron ratio - and decreasing shielding. 

This is dependent on the electronic configuration as well. 

![[Pasted image 20250506173251.png]]There are periodicity - Group 1 has lower ionisation energy. 

Noble gases have very high ionisation energy. 

Size of the nuclear charge - distance from nucleus - shielding effect of inner electrons. 

Spin-pair repulsion. 

Increasing across a period as the number or protons increases - nuclear charge increases - atomic radius to decrease 

shielding remains somewhat constant as we are only adding 1 per move. 

There would be a slight decrease due to spin pair repulsion. 

When we go down the group - we have one more principal quantum shell. 

![[Pasted image 20250506174627.png]]![[Pasted image 20250506174701.png]]

Iniosation down the group : charge does go up - but so does shielding as we add a whole new quantum shell and all of its subshells. 

The furtehr away electrons are the less attraction they experience. 

![[Pasted image 20250506175017.png]]**How did we get these idea of subshells : how did all of this develop** 
Electrons move rapidly around nucelus energy shells, if their energy increases, they jump to a higher (excite (go down is relax)) they absorb and they emit. 

The frequency - therefore the energy is the same, just going in and out. 

Depending on the configurations that we have, the energy will be any possibility of electrons jumping between energy shells. 

Energy emitted in visible region, examined through diffraction grating (think of something similar to a prism). 

Line/Atomic Emission Spectra
The lines suggest that there are only so many ways for an electron to move through energy levels. 

The packets of energy, aka quanta .

Closer together towards the blue area , this is convergence. 

The maximum corresponds to the ionisation energy. 

The highest energy line will be from the most energetic point to the least. 


Each shell holding 2n^2 electrons in total. 

![[Pasted image 20250506180042.png]]
Always 2 electrons per orbital. 

Filling singly before pairing up, two electrons in the same orbital must have the same spin. 

Pauli Exclusion Principle - same orbital - different spins

Aufbau Principle - Fill lowest energy orbitals first - remember 4s before 3d. 

Hund's Rule - fill singly first

Reactivity : number of electrons in outer most shell (valence electrons) 
Grp 1 - easily lose 1 e

Grp 7 - easily game 1 e

Ionisation energy shows the relationship with reactivity as well. 

Electronic configuration will dictate what kind of element will form ionic, covalent or metallic bonds. 
Similar configurations often have similar types of bonds. 


Periodicity : reduced atomic radius across a period. 
Electronegativity increases (better at attracting electrons) : ionization energy increases (harder to remove electrons as the nuclear charge increases). 

Down a Group:
- **Atomic radius** increases (more electron shells are added).
    
- **Ionization energy** decreases (electrons are farther from the nucleus and experience more shielding).
    
- **Electronegativity** decreases (electrons are farther from the nucleus, so it’s harder to attract new electrons).

Energy to move up to a higher orbital is greater than that to overcome spin pair repulsion. 

All electrons in same subshell have the same energy - degenerate - same energy level. 

Filling degenerate orbitals one at a time. 

Left to right across a period - electrons are adsded to the same energy level (shell). 

Number of protons increases by 1 as well, greater nuclear charge as well. 

Atoms more compact as we go across. 

Radii decreasing as we go down the group. 

**Trend**: Melting and boiling points increase to a maximum in the middle (like with **carbon**) and then decrease toward the noble gases.

With larger atoms in metal - the higher the boiling point and melting point. 

Same in group 7 - the halogens - as the increase in molecular size and therefore van der Waals Forces. 

**Remember This**: Chromium and Copper will differ ever so slightly, as they fill 4s and 3d with one each. 

![[Pasted image 20250506182403.png]]
They are more energetically stable. Only for these two
![[Pasted image 20250506182635.png]]
The rest fill up 4S first - think Aufbau principle - filling lowest first. 

Cr and Cu only for stability. 

**THIS IS UNIQUE TO CHROMIUM AND COPPER**. 

![[Pasted image 20250506182838.png]]

This gives it all away really as we see that 4s filles before 3d lol. 


Group - same number of valence electrons
Period - same quantum shell. 

Think about ionisation energies and electron affinity. 

![[Pasted image 20250506183352.png]]Boiling and melting points seem to go up in the middle and then down towards the sides. 

Explained by looking at the type of bonding that they all engage in.

Periodicity repeating patterns across the periodic table. 
![[Pasted image 20250506183447.png]]
Metal - Sea of the valence delocalised electrons. 
Na donates 1 - Mg donates 2 . 

Al - 3 - therfore Al is the strongest. 

Electrostatic forces between 3 + ion and delocalised electrons is higher. 

Si - giant molecular - therefore the highest - strong covalent bonds with neighbouring . 

The others are simple molecular. 
P4 S8 Cl2 and Ar (single atom, which won't react). 
The intramolecular (inside) - covalent bonds are strong. 
However the intermoleculars are weak - instantaneous dipole-induced dipole forces: 
Easier to break. 
Therefore the smaller the electron field - the weaker the intermolecular bond. 

Radius goes down across a group ( we get two atoms, measure the distance between them and divide by 2). 

**Ionic** : movement of electrons from one metal atom to a non-metal one 
Aiming to get to an outer shell. 

Metals lose electrons from their valence shell - cations (+ve ions). 

Their electronic configurations stay the same as a noble gas (very stable indeed). 

Square brackets are there to show that charge is evenly distribute over the ion. 

![[Pasted image 20250506185609.png]]
Cations and Anions are attracted to each other through electrostatic forces, between the oppositely charged ions - non-directional bonding as they attract in all directions. 

Very strong - requiring lots of energy to break. 

![[Pasted image 20250506185841.png]]
The ions will form a lattice structure, evenly distributed crystalline structure. 

Regular repeating pattern - attractions occurring in all directions. 

Overall electrically neutral. 

![[Pasted image 20250506190122.png]]For something like nitrogen we need 3 electrons - therefore we would need three Li atoms. 

Isoelectronic ions - same number of electrons
N³⁻, O²⁻, F⁻, Na⁺, Mg²⁺, Al³⁺
The radius does decrease as we go across here, but they have the same number of electrons : 
As the nuclear charge increases (more protons) electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus. 
Resulting in smaller ionic radii. 

N³⁻ > O²⁻ > F⁻ > Na⁺ > Mg²⁺ > Al³⁺

Ionic radii increase with increasing negative charge. 
Ionic radii decrease with increasing positive charge. 

The greater the negative charge - the larger the radius. 

![[Pasted image 20250506225806.png]]
You can see the greater the negative charge - 

Physical Properties of Ionic Compounds
Crystalline - regular, repeating 3D arrangements 

Ionic - electrostatic force of attraction between a cation and an anion (non-metal). 

Metal - positive - transferring electrons to the anion. 

Non-directional attraction - attracted in all directions. 

Giant Ionic Lattices (giant ionic structures). 

Most are solid at room temp - not enough energy to overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between oppositely charged ions, making up the lattice. 

High temps required. 

Na2O is 1405k and CaO 2845k - this is because of the greater charge (Ca2+). 

Conduct in molten state or in solution. 

Many will dissolve in polar solvents eg. water. 

Solubility depends on the kinetics and energetics that we will see later. 
1. breaking down the lattice 
2. the polar molecules attracting and creating bonds surrounding the ions. 

Strength of bonds created have to overcome the energy to break the ionic electrostatic forces between the two ions. 

Therefore, more simply, the greater the ionic charge, the more difficult it's going to be. 

There are exceptions to this. 

**Evidence For the Existence of Ions**: 
Behaviour during electrolysis is a clear piece of evidence for the existence of ions. 

The positive ions are attracted to the negative electrode (cathode) and the negative ions to the positive (anode). Anions to the anode, cations to the cathode. 

Look at copper chromate, where Cu(2+) is blue and CrO4(2-) is Yellow, and with the right electrodes, we get that separation. 

**Covalent Bonding Overview**: 

Between non-metals - Electrostatic attraction between nuclei of two atoms and the bonding electrons (shared electrons) of their outer shells. 
NO transfer - only sharing. 

Achieving electronic configuration like that of the nearest noble gas (gaining in this case). 

![[Pasted image 20250506232345.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250506232601.png]]Just want to achieve noble gas configuration. 

![[Pasted image 20250506232633.png]]
Remember to share the lone pair. 

Dative covalent bonding - both electrons from one atom. 

They want to know about NH4 and AlCl3: 

NH3 is protonated : lone pair given from nitrogen. 

**Bond Length and Bond Strength**: 

Bond Energy - kJmol^-1 - energy required to break one mole of a specific covalent bond
The bigger this is, the strong the covalent bond is duh. 

*Bond Length*: 
The internuclear distance of two covalently bonded atoms. 

Distance from nucleus of one atom to another atom which forms the covalent bond. 
The internuclear distance. 
The greater the force - the closer the atoms become. 
Decreasing the bond legnth, increasing the strength of the bond. 

![[Pasted image 20250506235201.png]]
Triple will be the shortest. 

Then the shape of these molecules (covalent molecules tend to have some weird shapes).
