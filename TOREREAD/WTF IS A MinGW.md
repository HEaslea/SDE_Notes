"**minimal GNU for Windows**"

### What is a GNU?
Refers to the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Produced by GNU Project. 
- GCC - collection of compilers for various programming languages, including C, C++ and Fortrain, Ada etc. etc. Known for standards compliance
- MinGW (minimal GNU for windows) Providing a set of GNU tools, including GCC, as well as libraries and libs and headers that are necessary for building native Windows applications. 

Latest minGW this guy is willing to share in order to get some new libs that we can't be bothered to do ourselves. 


Just get someone else to do it, otherwise we have to install all the libs and bins and include them in the right way, however, I like this one
: 
[Current Patch of MinGW Distro](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html)

He put a lot of effort in to make sure that this is as small as possible, however, it still has a lot of extracting to do. 

The only thing I did really here was extract to `C:\`.
