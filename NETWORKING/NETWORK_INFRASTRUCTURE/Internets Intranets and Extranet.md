### Understanding a Network
Nearly everything connects to the internet nowadays (even my fridge)> 

**Internet of Things (IoT)** - network of physical devices, vehicles and appliances : anything and everything will be given the opportunity to connect to a network in some way. 

What do all the devices that can connect have in common : they all have a **Network Interface Card (a NIC)**, they are running a **Network Operation System (a NOS)**. 
 They will be coded in a way that takes advantage of one or more of the networking protocols that are available. 
 
**Protocol** - A set of rules or standards that have to be adhered to. 

Shared **Medium** : Network Medium - Network Media : Talking about the channel that the data is being transferred across. Airwaves for wireless etc. 

Identifying Devices : Hostnames - IP Addresses - MAC Addresses - They are not mutually exclusive, most networks utilize all three. 

### Understanding Internet
There is a subtle difference between internet and Internet - internet is derived from the inter-network and refers to the connectivity between different networks. 
Internet - when capitalized - refers to the services that are publicly available outside of our own networks and the supporting infrastructure. 

Say we have Company A's infrastructure connecting directly to Company B's - this would be be an inter-network. They are not publicly available. This would be an internet (inter-network). 

Then there is the idea of Internet - connecting to web pages such as Facebook or Hotmail, or FTP (File Transfer Protocol) server, this is the Internet, as they are publicly available. 

The **I**nternet and the **World Wide Web** are not the same. 
**Internet** - with capital I - referring to services and infrastructure. 

WWW is only a portion of the services that the Internet provides, albeit a very large one. 
Servers that provide websites to end users. 

#### Understanding Intranets
**Intra** - meaning **inside**. 

Relating to network communication within out network. 
They are restricted to that network. 

We have to make sure that all of the access and authentication is controlled so that everything remains private, and none can be found from the Internet. 

Some organizations host internal web pages, such as collab tools such as SharePoint from Microsoft, Human Resource self-service portals. 

#### Understanding Extranets
Allowing access to intranet to other organizations. 
This is a security risk, therefore access only for permitted and trusted (authorized) organizations such as our business partners or our large customers. 

Say Company A - selling specialist Circuit Boards; Company B uses these as key components for a product. 
Before B takes any orders, they need to ensure A has all the boards in stock. 
They could call or email, this could be multiple times a day. 
Would it not be 100% easier to just have that access, so that they don't have to call consistently? Yes, obviously, that's why we need an **Extranet**. 

**This is not the same as as Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), aka a perimeter network.**

For an extranet we need to look at **trusted** or **authorized**.
