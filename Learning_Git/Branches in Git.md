### WHY? 
- To work on the same project in different ways
- Multiple people working on the same project at the same time. 

A line of development. 
Branch - One line of development, and off that we create secondary branches, *topic branches* or *feature branches*. 

These branches are short lived. 
They are incorporated back in to the primary branch and then deleted.

**Branches are movable pointers to commits.**

`HEAD -> main`, `HEAD` is not a branch.

The dir `heads` will hold a file for reach local branch in the local repo - `refs` stands for references.
There would only be `main` at that moment.
