## Modern Environments
Docker has changed the landscape. 

ARM-Based AWS Graviton. 

Environment refers to the setup, context in which software or systems run in. 

Combination of Hardware : Software : Configuration : Conditions where a program/process operates. 

#### Why OS's
Otherwise we would be doing everything, memory management, interrupt handling, talking with I/O devices, managing files, configuring and managing the network stack - more and more - a crazy amount of thingsz. 

The OS abstracts all of this away, giving us a clean API, such is the case with the Linux Kernel. 
The API that the OS exposes are system calls, or syscalls for short.
